**Project Description**:
A program which can simulate a Rubik's Cube.
* [Youtube Demonstration](https://youtu.be/D-pmMfCimU) //This is just a placeholder video.

**Project Goals**:
* [x] Learn how to write in C++
* [x] Learn how to create functions and classes and data structures work in C++
* [x] Write a class which simutates all the properties and functions of a Rubik's cube.
    * [x] Write another class which simulates the pieces of the Rubic Cube and arange them in a list or array contained by the Rubik's cube.
* [ ] If time allows, create a GUI for the Rubik's cube.
